  <category_description> &lt;p&gt;KERN-HEAP panics are raised by the kernel when bad parameters are passed to kernel-side heap functions. &lt;/p&gt;</category_description>
  <panics>
    <panic>
      <panic_id>39</panic_id>
      <panic_description>&lt;p&gt;This panic is raised when the size specified for the new heap is smaller than the permitted minimum; it must be at least the size of a RHeap object. On the user side this is associated with the USER category; on the kernel side this is associated with the KERN-HEAP category. &lt;/p&gt;</panic_description>
    </panic>

      <panic_description>&lt;p&gt;This panic is raised in a call to the RHeap member functions, AllocLen(), Free(), FreeZ(), ReAlloc(), ReAllocL(), Adjust() and AdjustL(), when a pointer passed to these functions does not point to a valid cell. On the user side this is associated with the USER category; on the kernel side this is associated with the KERN-HEAP category. &lt;/p&gt;</panic_description>
    </panic>
    <panic>
      <panic_id>213</panic_id>
      <panic_description>&lt;p&gt;This panic is raised when attempting to set a new debug failure mode on a heap with an invalid argument. For example, if aBurst &gt; KMaxTUint6 when invoking __UHEAP_BURSTFAILNEXT when a RHeap object is used for the user heap. On the user side this is associated with the USER category; on the kernel side this is associated with the KERN-HEAP category. &lt;/p&gt;</panic_description>
